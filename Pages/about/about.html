                 ONE YEAR CAN CHANGE A LIFE!
             </h2>

             <h3 class="ans"><span class="quote">"</span>As a teenager, I walked to my school bus stop through a very low-income
               neighborhood. Every day, I saw people cooking, eating, and living their lives
               on the side of the streets. The deprivation, misery, and loss of human dignity
               brought about by poverty deeply saddened me. I made a personal commitment to
               never forget what I experienced, and to help solve this immense problem.</h3>
               <h3 class="ans">
               As I started my final year of high school, I decided I wanted to go to the Indian
               Institutes of Technology (IIT), which had a reputation for being a difficult engineering
               school to get into. Most students who got into IIT were typically in the top 2-3 of their
               high school class. I had never been even in the top 20 of any class.</h3>
               <h3  class="ans">
               So I spent my final year of high school taking as many extra classes as I
               could and doing everything I could think of to help prepare for the entrance exam.
               I gave up watching cricket matches, movies and television. I would get up at 4:30 AM and
               travel 2 hours to the living room of a gifted mathematics teacher, to learn with him
               before I went to school. I skipped the annual family summer vacation. That entire year
               I focused deeply on preparing for this single examination so I could have a chance to
               attend IIT.</h3>
               <h3 class="ans">And at the end of the year, I was accepted. Having gotten into
                that university transformed my career options and brought many opportunities.
                This led me to think that in an average person’s education, one intensive year
                of extra learning opportunities can have a significant impact on their career.
                Through the work of FEA, I am seeking to provide that one year experience to as
                 many people as possible, with the hope that it will make a significant and
                 lasting impact in their lives.<span class="quote">"</span>
